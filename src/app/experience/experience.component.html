                        In my role as a Software Development Intern, I was responsible for ensuring that our clients’ corporate websites were kept up-to-date and error-free, initially using Joomla as the content management system (CMS) and later Jaiha. 
                        Through our web portal, I managed the renewal and maintenance of clients’ licenses, using advanced technologies such as database management. In addition, I was responsible for resolving tickets at the back-end, front-end or database level, depending on the needs of the client, colleagues or the company team. 
                        This task was achieved in close collaboration with the CRM team, with whom we maintained a professional and productive relationship.

                        As a Junior Developer, I supported the development and management of requirements, estimating the time and resources needed.
                        I assisted in the definition and execution of test scenarios to ensure optimal project performance, collaborated in project planning and monitoring, resolving conflicts when necessary. 
                        I worked alongside the functional analyst to interpret and understand the client's needs and contributed to the design of solutions and the preparation of progress reports. 
                        I participated in the implementation of products and services, ensuring customer satisfaction, monitored each phase of the project, supervising time, quality and risks, and provided support in the management of platform cases by providing ongoing support.
