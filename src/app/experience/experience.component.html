                        In my role as a Software Development Intern, I was responsible for ensuring that our clients’ corporate websites were kept up-to-date and error-free, initially using Joomla as the content management system (CMS) and later Jaiha. 
                        Through our web portal, I managed the renewal and maintenance of clients’ licenses, using advanced technologies such as database management. In addition, I was responsible for resolving tickets at the back-end, front-end or database level, depending on the needs of the client, colleagues or the company team. 
                        This task was achieved in close collaboration with the CRM team, with whom we maintained a professional and productive relationship.
